#  It contains indices used to plot the arrows on Fig 1 of Ingram & Bushell (2021, GRL).
#  The basic idea is to compare ECS and resolution of the CMIP5 & CMIP6 GCMs from each GCM development team that had GCMs in both rounds.
#  However most such teams had more than one in either or both round, often at different resolution.  GCMs in the same round with the same resolution are averaged.  Where a team has models of different resolution in just one of these stages of CMIP, both are compared with the single resolution in the other stage.  Where it has different resolutions in both, the two lower-resolution cases are compared & the two higher-resolution cases are compared.  (There is no case where both resolutions in one round are greater than both in the other, or with more than 2 resolutions.)
#  All this is done separately for vertical & horizontal resolutions.
#  Whitespace-separated columns are indices for the groups of GCMs to be averaged (maybe only 1) for a CMIP5 start of an arrow (0), the same for the CMIP6 end of the arrow (1), & then a short indication of the comparison.
